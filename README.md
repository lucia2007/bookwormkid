# Bookworm Kid
![Bookwormkid](/readme-images/amiresponsive.png)

Bookwormkid is an application which can be used in real life by anyone who is interested in supporting their child's, grandchild's or pupil's reading journey and help them fall in love with reading. I am sure there is no need to explain why reading skills are important for the development of the child, but detailed information can be found [here](https://www.highspeedtraining.co.uk/hub/why-is-reading-important-for-children/) if interested.

The app's main purpose is to provide age appropriate literature for all kinds of readers which would take their reading levels into account, so no reader is dissuaded or discouraged by too difficult a text, but also suggesting interesting and enticing literature for avid and passionate readers whose reading skills are above average for their age group.

Reading doesn't come easily to everyone and while some child might be able to read his way through Harry Potter or even The Lord of the Rings at the age of 7, other children might find it difficult to read through much simpler stories at a much higher age.

Having observed many children in their early reading journey, I can tell each road to proficient reading is different and just as a reluctant reader can be put off by too difficult a text or a "baby" story, so can a prolific reader be dissuaded by a story which isn't age appropriate or interesting enough.

As a mother of four young children I have always strived for them to acquire and improve their reading skills from early on. I provided lots of Montessori materials for them and other aids to help them on the journey to becoming proficient readers. However, when I was looking for books that would be appropriate for their age and reading level, I often couldn't find books which would correspond to their current needs and skills. This was especially true about their native languages which are Czech and Slovak. The books which are available for early readers in these languages are often way too difficult, too long, unintestring or plain and definitely couldn't serve as a source of joy to the early avid or struggling readers.

In the English speaking countries, the reading system is much better developped, throught-through and adjusted to different ages and reading skills/levels. Children can pick a book which is the right level for them and take it from there.

However, even in the English speaking environment, it is not easy to find books which would not be only age or skill appropriate, but both at the same time. Even a great [online resource](oxfordowl.com) which provides great age segmentation for young readers, doesn't provide interesting content for struggling readers of a higher age or profilic young readers. (I'm sure no struggling 8 year old would want to read "A very hungry caterpillar" or "Biff, Chip and Kipper" series which might correspond to their reading level if they are reluctant readers, but wouldn't correspond to their age or maturity level.)

I have heard of software available to schools which can diagnose a child's reading level and suggest books which would be age appropriate at the same time. However, this software is not available to broad public and it is very hard to find fun books for reluctant and struggling readers who need to be pulled into an age appropriate story.

Most of the major bookstores which I have browsed through do provide segmentation taking age into account, but often it is too broad: early readers, first-grade readers, young adults, and none of these have subsegments for struggling, average or avid readers.

Thus I would like to fill this market niche with this online bookstore which would cater for a specific age segment (5-12), early/young readers, but would take the children's reading skills and maturity into account.

<!-- 
Future feature
Another major feature of this bookstore would be a possibility to return books for a credit which can subsequently be used when buying a new book. This was suggested by my friend Amy and also encouraged by real life application in one of my favorite bookstores. This would make our shopping behaviour more responsible and contribute to sustainability while at the same time allowing children at any age to be supplied with mind-blowing stories which they can't put away. -->

At this stage the bookstore is focused on English literature only, but it is my deepest wish for children all over the world to have access to literature which will transport them into a different world and make their lives richer in their own langauges whatever their reading skills are.

# Project

## Objective

## Site User's Goal

The main goal of the site user is to interesting age and reading skill appropriate books for their chidren, grandchildren or pupils.
## Site Owner's Goal

As the site owner I want to provide a range of books for all young readers notwithstanding what their reading skill is so, so they can discover the world of books and fall in love with reading.

# User Experience (UX)

## Primary Goal

The primary goal of this application is to enable a purchase of age appropriate literature which takes a child's skill level and maturity into account. The shopping experience needs to be seemless and smooth.

## Visitor Goals

As a visitor I want to find a fun and enticing book for my child/grandchild/pupil which will encourage them to make reading a regular and important part of their lives.

### First Time Visitor

### Returning Visitor


### Frequent Visitor

  - A user can easily find a suitable book and make a quick purchase thanks to the saved personal and billing information.

# Creation Process

When I started creating the web application, I had a very clear idea of what I wanted to achieve. I wanted to create an attractive enticing eshop where the user would easily find a great book for their young reading. Firstly, I designed wireframes, then I proceeded to create the ERD schema and subsequently I focused on writing down user stories and planned my sprints.

## Design Prototype (Wireframes)

I started by creating wireframes which is always a great process because it helps me think in much more detail about what I want to accomplish. As you will see from my wireframes I tried to work on my design including the hero picture and color scheme from the very beginning. I came across the wonderful picture of the girl happily reading a book when travelling in France and later I was able to find it on the internet. The author of this amazing mural is Jef Aerosol.

The wireframes include a view for desktop, tablet and mobile to take responsives into accout. Many of the simple pages look the same on all devices (sign in, sign up, logout, forms,...). For those whose layout is different on smaller devices, I created a sample wireframe. The main difference in smaller screen is a collapsed NavBar accessible at the hamburger icon and the footer where the items stack up. The number of displayed books and other relevant features also responds to the size of the screen.

I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com) which is an excellent tool for making wireframes.

## Project Management

I have been using GitHub projects for organizing my project, tracking user stories and epics. It is a very helpful tool which enabled me to keep all my PBIs in one place and to tackle them gradually.

At the beginning of the project, I spent a fair amount of time on project planning, on thinking it through. I created wireframes and a sketch of my models first. Having the wireframes and the ERD model to refer to when working on the project was both essential and very helpful. Any time I was getting lost or confused, I could consult them and figure out how to proceed.

<!-- Reflecting back on my experience with PP4, I feel more confident about planning of the sprints and I planned them right at the beginning. -->

[Back to top](#contents)

My sprints were planned out as follows:

### Sprint #1 - 04/09 - 08/09

In the first milestone my main goal was to get the project's framework set up and running.  I also added Login/Registration functionality using django-allauth. Most of this sprint was about setting up the backend and the tasks were labeled as Dev Task (DT). The following tasks where a part of this sprint:

<!-- Early deployment? -->

- DT Install of Django Environment
- DT Create Django Project
- DT Set Up Django allauth
- DT Create an admin panel
- DT Create Database models from ERD
